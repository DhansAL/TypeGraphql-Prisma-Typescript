# TypeGraphql-Prisma-Typescript Starter template.

### TECH INSIDE

- TypeGraphQL
- Apollo-express-server v3
- Prisma v4
- Typescript v4.7
- TypegraphQL-prisma extension.
- nodemon (hmr). This does not uses ts-node-dev

### Why to use prisma and typeGraphQL?

It is possible to make the graphql server with only typegraphql and prisma as our ORM but, typegraphql-prisma provides things like, auto-generated models, resolvers, InputTypes and much more in reference with our prisma schema. This helps to get started with stuff much faster. Although you may have to modify the model fields generated by TypegraphQL or you can also select the resolvers you may choose to expose.

This template was made as a minimal starter template for your graphql server. you may choose to tune it according to your needs.

### NOTE
Please generate types and migrations in the sample prisma schema to test locally. also make a database in your local database before initiating migrations.

### Scripts

1. install the deps.

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Watch and run the build by using,

```bash
yarn watch
yarn start
```

3. Dry or single run the dev by

```bash
yarn start-dev
```

4. For general dev run with HMR

```bash
yarn dev-ts
```

### Prisma scripts

After building your schema,

to generate migrations

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

to generate prisma client and typegraphql resolvers and more,

```
npx prisma generate
```
